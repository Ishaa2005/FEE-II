        <h3>About the book:- </h3>
        <p><b><i>‘I thought of running away with Kamla. When I mentioned 
            it to her, her eyes lit up. She thought it would be great fun. Women
             in love can be more reckless than men! But I had read too many stories about 
             runaway marriages ending in disaster, and I lacked the courage to go through 
             with such an adventure. I must have known instinctively that it would not work. 
             Where would we go, and how would we live? 
            There would be no home to crawl back to, for either of us.’</i></b> <br>
            Seldom do we come across a person who leaves behind an impression on our very being.
             Call it being enamoured or moved, the memories we shared with them can catch us 
            unawares even years down the line. It is not for the world to decipher what
             bond we shared and nurtured with them, or how real or surreal it was. 
             This is our secret alone, meant to be kept close to the heart.
            In The Girl on the Train, we see tales of longing and lost 
            bonds being traced again in Ruskin Bond’s 
            simplistic narration. With these stories,
             you might once again walk down the memory lane of all those cherished 
             moments gone by.</p>
